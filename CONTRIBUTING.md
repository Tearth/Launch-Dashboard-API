## Pull Request Steps

**NOTE**: Make sure every change is covered by a unit test.

1. Fork the repo, make changes, add tests, commit, and submit a Pull Request

2. New Pull Requests will automatically trigger a Travis CI Build

3. If the build fails, look at the [Build Logs](https://travis-ci.org/shahar603/Launch-Dashboard-API/).
Changes will not be merged unless the build passes

4. If the build succeeds, the pull request will be reviewd, and when merged will be automatically
pushed to the production server at [api.launchdashboard.space](https://api.launchdashboard.space)
